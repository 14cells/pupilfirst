### Features

  - A _Graduation_ page has been created to showcase our graduation
    efforts & results.
  - Vocalist now responds to `targets?` command, responding with
    list of targets. She can also supply more information with
    `targets info [NUMBER]`

### Performance

  - Sped up first load of the website by tweaking a setting on
    the visit logging library.

### Bugfixes

  - Blank entries were being shown on Startups page's filter
    (Google Chrome, on Windows).
  - Vocalist will correctly notify everyone of multiple targets
    being deployed together to a batch.
  - Founders can no longer register with phone numbers already
    linked to others.
