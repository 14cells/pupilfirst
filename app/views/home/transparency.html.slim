          p Through our not-for-profit entity, we receive access to Government and Private funds as grants. As part of a public-private partnership with state and national governments, we also steward entrepreneurship-development and founder-training programs across India. This receives understandable scrutiny from the media and general public, and through our transparency initiative, we want to proactively share  information about Startup Village.
          p This is still a work-in-progress. If you'd like to see more information here, please write to <a href="mailto:help@sv.co">help@sv.co</a>.
