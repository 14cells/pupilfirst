                    ' We're excited to partner with Paytm to offer full merit-based scholarships to <strong>30 deserving founders</strong>. There is no separate application for scholarship, we'll award them automatically based on your team scores in the selection rounds. Scholarships are awarded to individual founders and not to the team as a whole.
                  p
                    ' Scholarship Awards will be based on the following rules:
                  ul.m-t-1
                    li Only candidates who successfully clear the selection process will be awarded scholarships.
                    li If your parent's annual income is below â‚¹3,50,000, you are eligible for financial aid and will be considered first, in order of your team ranking in the selection rounds. When you come for the Personal Interview round, please carry a letter from your College Principal and HOD that states this fact.
                    li The remaining scholarships will be automatically awarded based on your ranking in the selection rounds.
                  p If you have any doubts about scholarships, write to us at help@sv.co
