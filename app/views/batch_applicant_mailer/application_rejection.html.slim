    ' But Hey! All's not bad - a lot of the teams only make it to Startup Village only on their second or third attempts and <strong>we want to give you one more chance!</strong>

      We're launching a new challenge to become part of the January batch and you can attempt it free of cost, unlike new applicants.

      We're hoping that you'll give it another shot and come out victorious.

    ' Come back to #{link_to 'www.sv.co/apply', apply_url} on 25th October to receive your new challenge.
