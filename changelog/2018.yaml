    title: The organization of targets in the user's dashboard has been overhauled.
      The tabs at the top of the page used to switch between targets (tasks), and
      sessions (one-to-many video conference events). These tabs now switch between
      _tracks_ - a brand new grouping of targets **and** sessions that are intended
      to serve a particular purpose. We'll be working on grouping program content
      into tracks over the next couple of months.

    description: This is a major change. Many systems related to how targets are organized
      have been rewritten to allow for _tracks_ of targets. See Trello card for more
      details.

    title: The fee payment interface now asks for billing address before procceding
      to the payment gateway.
    trello: https://trello.com/c/3hubdXO6
    private: false
    description: This is a pretty big change. First of all, the static fee interface
      has been replaced with a React-powered one, adding Billing address fields which
      are submitted along with the fee submit request. This also makes a lot of changes
      to allow for the move to EMI model with a fixed maximum fee. Use of payment
      'period' has been removed entirely, and new code has been added to account for
      generation of EMI, the possibility of payments via NEFT that are sums above
      the EMI, etc. There's more work to be done here. For the time being, the interface
      will be deployed in the 'disabled' state, keeping fee payment locked down until
      all related work is complete, and we're ready for the next batch of students.
