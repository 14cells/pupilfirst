      this is no longer relevant.
    trello: https://trello.com/c/BF1F34Ih

    description: While there aren't very many visible effects here, there are a lot
      of changes under the hood. Faculty still needs to be manually assigned to a
      course, since the reviewer assignment feature is now hidden (until the school
      admin dashboard goes live).

      type_.
    trello: https://trello.com/c/ampsYf75
    private: false
    description: All submissions are now linked to targets displayed on the student

    trello: https://trello.com/c/7Vb4tVvA
    private: true
    description: This turns off the optional flag in founder to startup relationship,
      and alters a basic behavior in the application. Specs and some services have

      a level. This system would still prevent further leveling up unless all the
      milestone targets in their previous level have been completed

    trello: https://trello.com/c/yuSHzSnT

      rows for the same relationship to be entered twice. This introduces proper unique
      constraints.

      would allow students from any school to access level-restricted content as long

      such resources.

      generate JS from Reason code after packages are installed.
    trello: https://trello.com/c/pWm7bYY9
    private: true
    description: This fixes deployment issues on Heroku, which were broken because
      changes applied in the nodejs buildpack were not persisting to the ruby buildpack,
      blocking precompilation of assets. The nodejs buildpack has been removed since
      precompilation now does a yarn install first before getting started with its
      own thing.

      active users on platforms, that are shown on the dashboard. This makes it simpler

    title: The organization of targets in the user's dashboard has been overhauled.
      The tabs at the top of the page used to switch between targets (tasks), and
      sessions (one-to-many video conference events). These tabs now switch between
      _tracks_ - a brand new grouping of targets **and** sessions that are intended
      to serve a particular purpose. We'll be working on grouping program content
      into tracks over the next couple of months.

    trello: https://trello.com/c/3hubdXO6
    private: false
    description: This is a pretty big change. First of all, the static fee interface
      has been replaced with a React-powered one, adding Billing address fields which
      are submitted along with the fee submit request. This also makes a lot of changes
      to allow for the move to EMI model with a fixed maximum fee. Use of payment
      'period' has been removed entirely, and new code has been added to account for
      generation of EMI, the possibility of payments via NEFT that are sums above
      the EMI, etc. There's more work to be done here. For the time being, the interface
      will be deployed in the 'disabled' state, keeping fee payment locked down until
      all related work is complete, and we're ready for the next batch of students.
