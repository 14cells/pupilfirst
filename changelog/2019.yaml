    title: PupilFirst is now [open-source](https://git.pupilfirst.com)! This project's
      overall goal has always been to make modern tooling available in the field of
      education, and to do so in a manner that promotes effective techniques for
      improving student outcome. Going open-source allows us to be transparent about
      the work that we do, and the changes we're making to the platform to aid that goal.
  - timestamp: '2019-09-02T10:31:45Z'
    title: The quiz editor in the school admin interface now has improved styling
      that makes the selected answer stand out in the list of possible answers - this
      decreases the likelihood that the target author will forget to select the right
      answer before moving on.
    category: ui
  - timestamp: '2019-08-30T11:41:56Z'
    title: The student submission form is now disabled when the attachment form contains
      a link that hasn't been _attached_ yet. The form now lets the user know that
      the link needs to be at _attached_ for it to count as a part of the submission.

    title: School admins can now sort targets and target groups using the curriculum
      editor, similar to how target content blocks are sorted.

      details of a coach.
    category: feature
  - timestamp: '2019-08-28T08:18:36Z'
    title: The leaderboard now properly excludes _inactive_ students from the aggregate
      counts displayed.
    category: bugfix
  - timestamp: '2019-08-28T08:17:31Z'
    title: Fixed incorrect page rendering that could occur when school admins attempt
      to visit the leaderboard page without having a student profile.
    category: bugfix
  - timestamp: '2019-08-28T08:15:42Z'
    title: Many pages have been updated to redirect users to the sign in page if they
      haven't logged in (instead of 404-ing).
    category: ui
  - timestamp: '2019-08-28T08:14:15Z'
    title: Improved the informational message displayed when students are prevented
      from completing a target when they're in a lower level.
    category: ui
  - timestamp: '2019-08-28T08:13:10Z'
    title: School admins can no longer submit the target editor form with a blank
      _link-to-complete_. The form now proplerly blocks the user from submitting the
      form without the link.
    category: bugfix
- timestamp: '2019-08-20T06:02:52Z'
  changes:
  - timestamp: '2019-08-20T06:02:13Z'
    title: School administrators can now invite others to become admins.
    category: feature
  - timestamp: '2019-08-16T09:47:56Z'
    title: Levels that do not have milestone targets no longer show the option to
      level up - the level up button wouldn't have worked, but it obviously didn't
      make sense to show the option either.
    category: bugfix
  - timestamp: '2019-08-16T07:50:45Z'
    title: Schools admins can now export data about student submissions from the administartion
      interface.

      dashboard.

    title: We've fixed a number of bugs related to the markdown editor that is used
      in community pages and in the school administration interface by replacing the
      _textarea_-based implementation with one that uses Facebook's _Draft.js_ library.
    category: bugfix
  - timestamp: '2019-08-12T07:50:15Z'

      registration.
    category: feature
  - timestamp: '2019-08-12T07:45:38Z'
    title: Leaderboard _pagination_ links are now permalinks. The leaderboard navigation
      links used to use a page number for navigation, because of which, a paginated
      link would show a different leaderboard every week. This parameter has been
      replaced with a date, which allows leaderboard paginated links to always show
      the same leaderboard.
    category: feature
  - timestamp: '2019-08-12T07:43:30Z'
    title: The design for the leaderboard has been updated and merged into the student
      dashboard.

  - timestamp: '2019-08-12T07:35:04Z'

      submission, instead of just the latest one.
    category: ui
  - timestamp: '2019-08-12T07:34:04Z'
    title: Added the field _affiliation_ to students - this allows differentiation
      between student groups outside the school administration interface. It is currently
      displayed on the leaderboard and on community question pages.
    category: feature
  - timestamp: '2019-08-12T07:26:48Z'
    title: Added a placeholder logo on the school administration interface when the

      was clicked in quick succession. The button has also been updated to disable
      itself while a network request is ongoing.
    category: bugfix
  - timestamp: '2019-07-29T06:14:55Z'
    title: Fixed a crash that would occur when trying to download files that were
      attached to submissions.
    category: bugfix
  - timestamp: '2019-07-19T10:23:03Z'
    title: Users can now set a new password for signing in, or request a password
      reset from the sign in menu. Using any of the federated sign-in methods (Google,
      Facebook, Github) is still preferred, as it is the most secure option; however
      signing in with passwords is convenient when the email isn't linked with any
      of the providers.
    category: feature
  - timestamp: '2019-07-18T09:55:49Z'
    title: Email notifications have been enabled for community updates. Answers to
      your questions or comments on your questions or answers will trigger an immediate
      email. An additional _community digest_ email will also be sent daily, listing
      new questions and unanswered questions from the past week. The diget email can
      be controlled from the edit user profile page.
    category: feature
- timestamp: '2019-07-16T10:01:44Z'
  changes:
  - timestamp: '2019-07-16T08:12:40Z'
    title: The back button on the _New Question_ page now takes the user back to where
      they came from (community index, or target details page), instead of always
      linking to the community index.
    category: ui
  - timestamp: '2019-07-16T07:46:18Z'
    title: The ordering of answers in the community section has been improved; answers
      with more _likes_ are listed first, and if two have the same number of likes,
      the newest is preferred.
    category: ui
  - timestamp: '2019-07-11T09:42:18Z'
    title: Fixed a crash which could occur when users uploaded a profile pictures

      MB.

    category: bugfix
  - timestamp: '2019-07-11T09:38:23Z'

  - timestamp: '2019-06-28T07:38:10Z'
    title: The student dashboard has been overhauled with a fresh design, and the
      target details overlay has been upgraded to allow us to present rich documents
      as content for students to consume. School admins can now author much larger
      documents as content for targets, freely introducing blocks of markdown, embeds
      from various sites, images, or files for students to download.
    category: feature
  - timestamp: '2019-06-10T05:21:00Z'
    title: We have a new home _landing page_ for the signed-in user. Users can now
      see all the courses and communities they belong to in a single page. All course
      related links are also directly accessed from this page.
    category: feature
  - timestamp: '2019-06-10T04:58:41Z'
    title: The community feature is now live! This new features enables school admins
      to create multiple communities in a school where students can discuss target
      and other doubts with their peers. All communities linked to a course can now
      be directly accessed from the student dashboard. Students who have access to
      a community can ask question, answer questions from others, and _upvote_ answers.
      Coaches act as moderators for the community. The author of the community resource,
      or any coach, can edit or remove _said_ resources. The content of questions,
      answers, and comments are versioned, to keep track of changes, and _Markdown_
      can be used to format the content of questions, answers and comments.
    category: feature
  - timestamp: '2019-05-09T08:04:27Z'
    title: Fixed a bug that prevented the coach review dashboard from loading previously
      reviewed submissions in some cases.
    category: bugfix
  - timestamp: '2019-05-03T13:33:47Z'
    title: Student submissions can now be _un-done_ / deleted right after they are
      submitted, and directly from the target details overlay. This replaces the old
      approach of navigating to the student's profile page to be able to delete a
      submission. Like before, only un-reviewed submissions can be deleted.
    category: ui
  - timestamp: '2019-04-25T10:12:57Z'
    title: There's a new customization interface which school admins can use to change
      various aspects of the school's appearance, from logos and icons, to links and
      legal agreements.

    title: Improved UX on coach review dashboard - this update allows coaches to search

  - timestamp: '2019-03-11T12:17:55Z'

      when the link is visited.
    trello: https://trello.com/c/cJOoHOgU
    private: false
    description: The feature seems to have never been properly implemented. This _completes_
      the feature, causing a click on the _Visit_ button to complete the target, and
      _then_ take the user to the stored URL.

      for students who go through a course as a team. With this update, students can
      now see which team members still have to complete targets that they have to
