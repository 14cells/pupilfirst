    title: Improved UX on coach review dashboard - this update allows coaches to search
      for a student in their list, and to load previous submissions from students
      when the filter is active. Messaging in these screens has also been improved.

      reinstated with a brand new design.

    description: This change removes the old WeeklyKarmaPoints leaderboard implementation

    title: Targets which can be completed by visiting a link now _actually_ complete
      when the link is visited.

    private: false
    description: The feature seems to have never been properly implemented. This _completes_
      the feature, causing a click on the _Visit_ button to complete the target, and
      _then_ take the user to the stored URL.

    title: We've tweaked the behavior of the target overlay on the student dashboard,
      for students who go through a course as a team. With this update, students can
      now see which team members still have to complete targets that they have to
      tackle independently. It's cleaner than the earlier approach of displaying the
      status for every student in the team.

    title: Auto-verified targets now behave correctly when they're also team targets

      to be individually assigned to students (or teams) to gain review access.
