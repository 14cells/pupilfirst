    title: We have a new and flexible grading system! Course admins will now be
      able to configure how they want to review student submissions. A sleek grade

      a configurable pass_grade. Each grade will have it's own label too. For example,
      2/5 in our existing courses is a 'Needs Improvement'.

    title: We've tweaked the behavior of the target overlay on the student dashboard,
      for students who go through a course as a team. With this update, students can
      now see which team members still have to complete targets that they have to
      tackle independently. It's cleaner than the earlier approach of displaying the
      status for every student in the team.

    title: Auto-verified targets now behave correctly when they're also team targets
      (completed together as group). The platform used to assume that such targets
      were always individually completed.

    title: Coaches can now be assigned directly to multiple courses so that they can review
      submissions from all students taking the course. Previously they had to be individually
      assigned to students (or teams) to gain review access.
