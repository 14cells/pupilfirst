title: Faculty (coaches) can now be assigned to courses, so that they can review submissions
  from all students enrolled in the course.

description: While there aren't very many visible effects here, there are a lot of
  changes under the hood. Faculty still needs to be manually assigned to a course,
  since the reviewer assignment feature is now hidden (until the school admin dashboard
  goes live).
