title: The organization of targets in the user's dashboard has been overhauled. The tabs
  at the top of the page used to switch between targets (tasks), and sessions
  (one-to-many video conference events). These tabs now switch between _tracks_ - a brand
  new grouping of targets **and** sessions that are intended to serve a particular
  purpose. We'll be working on grouping program content into tracks over the next couple
  of months.

description: This is a major change. Many systems related to how targets are organized
  have been rewritten to allow for _tracks_ of targets. See Trello card for more details.
