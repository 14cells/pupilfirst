title: Replaced heroku-postbuild script with general node postinstall script to generate
  JS from Reason code after packages are installed.

description: This fixes deployment issues on Heroku, which were broken because changes
  applied in the nodejs buildpack were not persisting to the ruby buildpack, blocking
  precompilation of assets. The nodejs buildpack has been removed since precompilation
  now does a yarn install first before getting started with its own thing.
