  the payment gateway.

description: This is a pretty big change. First of all, the static fee interface has
  been replaced with a React-powered one, adding Billing address fields which are
  submitted along with the fee submit request. This also makes a lot of changes to
  allow for the move to EMI model with a fixed maximum fee. Use of payment 'period'
  has been removed entirely, and new code has been added to account for generation
  of EMI, the possibility of payments via NEFT that are sums above the EMI, etc. There's
  more work to be done here. For the time being, the interface will be deployed in
  the 'disabled' state, keeping fee payment locked down until all related work is
  complete, and we're ready for the next batch of students.
