title: Replace shortener with custom solution
trello: https://trello.com/c/NG4FR0nY
private: true
description: This removes the shortener gem, and implements existing functionality
  (and more) with custom code. This replaces the default behavior of redirecting to
  a 404 page when an unknown /:id URL is encountered  by responding with a 404 status
  response.
