title: Replace github-linguist based LOC calculation with the cloc application.

private: true
description: This removes github-linguist and its dependencies. This will mean the
  removal of the apt buildpack on Heroku since it is not required, and the addition
  of the nodejs buildpack since cloc is installed using yarn. The LOC calculation
  made by github-lingust wasn't even LOC. It was calculating total size of code
  per language. All stored stats related to this value will need to be removed from
  the production database.
