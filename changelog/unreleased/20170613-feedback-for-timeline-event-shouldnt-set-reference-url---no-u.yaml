title: Feedback for timeline event shouldn't set reference URL - no usage of reference
  URL in this context should exist
trello: https://trello.com/c/imfHIC3k
private: true
description: Removed all instances where reference_url was stored when a startup_feedback
  is saved for a timeline_event. The StartupFeedback model methods are also updated
  to use timeline_event_id instead of reference_url to obtain the associated timeline_event.
