description: This is the ground work needed to implement skill tree for admitted founders.
  Targets will now have associated skills with a good, great, wow rubric and a base karma point.
  During the review process, a target will be graded for each of these skills. The rubric based on
  target skills will be available for download as a pdf in founder dashboard target overlay. Once
  verified the founder will be able to see the awarded grades highlight in the rubric pdf.
