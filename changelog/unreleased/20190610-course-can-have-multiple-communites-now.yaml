  The community feature is now live. The new features enables school admins to create multiple communities in a school.
  Students can now use the community feature to discuss target related doubts in the community. All the communities linked to a
  course can now be directly accessed from the students dashboard. Students who have access to a community can ask a question,
  answer a question, like answers and comment on both questions and answers. The coach acts as a moderator for the community.
  The author of the community resource/coach can edit or remove community resources. The versions of edited answers and comments
  are stored. The community suggest users to use markdown for formating their questions, answers and comments.
