description: 'The fix involved eliminating statuses of submitted targets from Level
  0 for admitted founders in Founders::TargetStatusService. Similar to method #unsubmitted_target_statuses,
  #submitted_target_statuses should only take into account statuses of #applicable_targets
  for all founders. This eliminates missing status of #all_target_prerequisites '
