title: Removed link to timeline page in feedback emails sent to Level 0 startups -
  since the timeline page is only active for Level 1+ startups

description: The feedback to Level 0 startups will definitely be associated with a
  target in the absence of adding any manual timeline events. Hence added the target
  name to the feedback email.
