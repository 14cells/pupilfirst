description:
  All the levels in a school are now open for preview. The user can't submit
  higher level targets until they reach that level. They can now move on to the next
  level as soon as theyâ€™ve submitted all the milestone targets on a level. This system
  would still prevent further leveling up unless all the milestone targets in their
  previous level have been completed
