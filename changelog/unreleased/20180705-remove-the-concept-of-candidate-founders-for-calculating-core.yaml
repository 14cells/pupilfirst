title: Remove the concept of candidate founders for calculating core stats on admin
  dashboard.

description: This removes filters on calculation of counts and percentages of active
  users on platforms, that are shown on the dashboard. This makes it simpler to perform
  the calculations, but displays much lower quality data. We're doing this to allow
  compatibility with the new "schools" feature - this sort of specific calculation
  can be reintroduced later if required.
