# Users

There are three kinds of users within PupilFirst:

1. **School Admin:** They manage the school, and have access to the school administration interface.
2. **Coach:** They have access to all communities, and can review submissions from students or teams they are linked to.
3. **Students:** The have access to one or more courses and can submit work on targets. They also have access to commnunities that they're courses are linked to.

!> There is a fourth class of user - _course author_, that currently not exposed via the school administration interface. See [related Github issue](https://github.com/SVdotCO/pupilfirst/issues/125) for details.

## User profile

All users, regardless of their _type_ can edit their personal details user profile. There's a link to edit the profile on the _home_ page.

All fields except _Name_, are optional in the user profile edit form. These details are only visible to school admins, and conditionally, coaches. Coaches gain access to student's contact details if they're assigned to review their submissions.

### Communication preferences

Users can control whether they'd like to receive a daily community digest email from the user profile edit page. The purpose of this email is [explained in the communities page](/communities?id=daily-community-digest).
