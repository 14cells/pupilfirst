# Taking Courses

All students begin a course in its first level and progress through levels by completing targets. Specifically, they need to complete (or submit) all [milestone targets](/targets?id=milestone-targets) before they're allowed to _level up_.

## Structure of a course

While all of the content in the course is _visible_ to a student, right from the first level, they cannot _complete_ or submit work on targets until they've reached that level. This way, students are asked to go through the content of your course in a specific order.

Levels can contain targets that are optional, and targets can depend upon each-other in the form of prerequisites, which further allows you to customize the order in which students attempt targets. As an author, how you'll structure the content depends upon the nature of the topic that you're trying to teach.
