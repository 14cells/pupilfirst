# Taking Courses

All students begin a course in its first level and progress through levels by completing targets. Specifically, they need to complete (or submit) all [milestone targets](/targets?id=milestone-targets) before they're allowed to _level up_.

## Structure of a course

While all of the content in the course is _visible_ to a student, right from the first level, they cannot _complete_ or submit work on targets until they've reached that level. This way, students are asked to go through the content of your course in a specific order.

Levels can contain targets that are optional, and targets can depend upon each-other in the form of prerequisites, which further allows you to customize the order in which students attempt targets. As an author, how you'll structure the content depends upon the nature of the topic that you're trying to teach.

## Participating in the Community

When a community is linked to one or more courses, students in those courses can post questions in the community. In addition to this, if a community has the _Discuss Targets_ option is enabled, then students will see the _Discuss_ tab when they open targets. The tab shows questions other students have asked about the target in the past.

Because the issues that students face are often similar, having a history of doubts raised by previous students increases the likelihood that a student can immediately get answers for their doubts.

?> For the author of a course, these questions can also be an indicator that there are aspects of the target's content that could be improved.
