## Creating courses

To create a new course, head to the Courses menu from the school admin interface's navigation bar, and click the _Add New Course_ button at the top of the page.

The form that pops up will ask you for a few properties:

**Name**\
The name of the course, that will publicly displayed.

**Course description**\
This short description will be displayed on the course's public page.

**Course ends on**\
If set, students in your course will go into a _read-only_ mode after this date, and students will be shown a message that the course has ended. This effectively _closes_ the course, preventing students from making further submissions, but does not remove student's access to the content, or to the work that they submitted as a part of the course.

**About**\
This is a markdown field - you can use this to add descriptive text about your course. This will be displayed on the on the course's public page.

**Enable public signup for this course?**\
If enabled, members of the public will be able to sign up for your course.

**Grades**\
These are the grades that coaches can assign when they're reviewing a student's submission. You'll need to set a maximum grade (up to 10), and a minimum passing grade, and assign labels to each grade.

- If the passing grade is set to 1, then it will be impossible for students to _fail_ during grading.
- The labels for each grade helps to give them meaning, and to differentiate them for coaches.

!> This mechanics of grading will change soon. See the [related issue on Github](https://github.com/SVdotCO/pupilfirst/issues/14) for more details.

## Editing courses

To edit a course's details, simply click on the course in the Courses menu. The form for editing a course is identical to the one that you used to create it.
