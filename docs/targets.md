# Targets

## Locked targets

There are four situations in which a target can be _locked_ for a student:

1. The target is in a level that the student hasn't reached.
2. The target has other targets as pre-requisites that the student hasn't completed.
3. The student's access to the course has ended, because of which they have read-only access to the course content.
4. The target in question is a _milestone_ target, and students haven't gotten a passing grade in all of _last_ level's reviewed milestone targets.

The first three should feel straight-forward, but there's a bit to unpack in the third situation:

1. You've already seen that targets can be reviewed, and that coaches can assign failing grades.
2. Students are allowed to level up as soon as they've submitted work on all their milestone targets. This is allowed so that students aren't held up by delays that can occur in reviewing student submissions.
3. However, students shouldn't be allowed to _continue_ leveling up until their previous level's milestone targets have been confirmed as having qualified for the minimum passing grade.

This means that a student who is _locked_ in this way will need to re-submit work on the failed target again and get a passing grade before they're allowed to work on the milestone targets that are in their _current_ level.
