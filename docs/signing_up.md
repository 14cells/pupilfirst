# Signing Up

New students can enter a course in one of two ways:

1. A school admin [adds them via the students list](/students?id=adding-new-students).
2. [Public sign up is enabled](/courses?id=creating-courses) for a course.

![Course's public page](https://res.cloudinary.com/sv-co/image/upload/v1574405467/pupilfirst_documentation/signing_up/course_public_page_oqmoxv.png)

## Public Signup

When the public signup option is enabled on a course, the course's public page become visible, and students can read about the course before enrolling to it by supplying their name and email address. Their email address will be confirmed before they're added to the course, and they'll [begin the course in the first level](/curriculum_editor?id=what-are-levels).
