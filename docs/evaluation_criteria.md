# Evaluation Criteria

Evaluation criteria forms the basis for evaluating a student submission for a target by coaches. An evaluation criterion has a maximum grade
and a pass grade. Targets can be linked to multiple evaluation criteria, and coaches need to grade a student submission
for a target for each of these criterion.

## Adding and Editing Evaluation Criterion

To create a new evaluation criterion, visit the _Evaluation Criteria_ sub-menu within a course, and click the _Add new evaluation criterion_ button.

**Name**\
The name of the evaluation criterion, which will be displayed in the coach review interface and student grade card.

**Maximum grade**\
The maximum grade for the evaluation criterion. The allowed values range from 2 to 10.

**Pass grade**\
The pass grade for the evaluation criterion. This is the minimum grade a student should score to clear the criterion. If a target is assigned to multiple
evaluation criteria, a student needs to receive pass grade for each of these criteria for the target to be deemed as passed.

**Grade and Labels**\
This interface allows admin to create a label for each of the grade values. These labels appear both in the student grade card
and the review interface for coaches. If grades are not assigned any labels, the labels default to the text version of the grade, as one, two, three, etc.

An example of grade labels in a student grade card is as shown below:

The student submission here received grade of 5 for evaluation criterion with name _Quality of Submission_ and the label for grade 5 is _Wow_.
