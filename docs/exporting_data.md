# Exporting Data

PupilFirst has a robust data export feature that'll let you pull data out of the PupilFirst platform, and into a spreadsheet. This allows you to come up with your own analysis of the student data from a course.

![Course exports interface](https://res.cloudinary.com/sv-co/image/upload/v1574318122/pupilfirst_documentation/exporting_data/exports_page_aamvez.png)

To prepare a new export, visit the _Exports_ sub-menu within a course, and click the _Create a new export_ button. When preparing an export, you can limit the results to a select group of students by picking one or more tags that's associated with them.

The export may take a short while to prepare, so the platform will send you an email when it's ready. When it's done, you can download the export as an `.ods` (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) file that contains three sheets: _targets_, _students_, and _submissions_.

**Targets**\
This sheet includes a list of all targets _live_ targets in the course, ordered by level. The first column, `ID` is used to identify the target in the _Submissions_ sheet.

**Students**\
This is the list of active students requested in the export, and contains their personal details and tags. The first column, `Email Address`, will be used to identify the student in the _Submissions_ sheet.

**Submissions**\
This contains a list of all submissions from requested students for all the targets. Students are on the Y-axis, and targets are on the X-axis. The result of a target can be one of a couple of values depending on the _type_ of target.

1. A blank cell indicates an target that hasn't been attempted.
2. A check-mark (`âœ“`) indicates a target that is marked as complete, or completed by visiting a link.
3. A fraction (`1/3`) indicates the result of a quiz.
4. A colored cell with a grade (`3`) indicates the grade given to a reviewed target.
   - If there are multiple evaluation criteria, each grade will be comma-separated.
   - If the student receieved a passing grade, the cell will have a green background. Otherwise, the background will be red.
5. The string `RP`, with a yellow background indicates that the student has submitted work, but that its **r**eview is **p**ending.

!> We've been using the course data export feature heavily internally, and have noticed that it could use a few improvements. You can track updates to this feature on [the related Github issue](https://github.com/SVdotCO/pupilfirst/issues/64).

## How to use exports

While working with PupilFirst as school admins, we've realized that it's quite difficult (if not impossible) to predict the kind of analyses you'll want to perform ahead of time. On the other hand, if you can access the data on your students as a spreadsheets, it's often trivial to come up with new analyses by creating new formalae within a spreadsheet application.

You can use the data in the spreadsheet to generate all kinds of reports. For example:

1. Track the trend of overall student performance within a course, over time.
2. Track how well your coaches are able to keep up with their reviewing workload.
3. Determine which optional targets are most popular among students.

These are just a few tasks that we've used the exported data for. We're sure that there are many other use-cases for the data that we haven't thought of yet.

## Moving common analyses into the platform

As an admin, if you notice that you're repeatedly performing the same kind of analysis using exported spreadsheets, then it may be a candidate for inclusion as a feature within the platform. [We'd love to talk](mailto:support@pupilfirst.com) about improving the anayltics features of PupilFirst.

An example of a metric we've included using a similar process is the _average grade_ displayed within the student's report page. This is a number that is easy to calculate from the grades present in the spreadsheet, but was included in the report page because of its obvious utility and the ease with which it could be implemented within the platform.
